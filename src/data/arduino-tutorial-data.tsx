        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What is Arduino?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          At its core, an Arduino consists of a microcontroller (like a tiny computer) on a circuit board, along with input/output (I/O) pins that allow you to connect sensors, motors, lights, and other electronic components. You can program the microcontroller to read inputs (like light from a sensor, or a finger on a button) and turn it into an output â€“ activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why Use Arduino?</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">

        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Download the Arduino IDE</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Go to the official Arduino website (<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">arduino.cc/en/software</a>) and download the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Install it like any other software.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Connect Your Arduino Board</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable. The green power LED (labeled PWR) should light up.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Configure the Arduino IDE</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Open the Arduino IDE. You need to tell the IDE which board you are using and which serial port it's connected to.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>

          <li>
            <strong>Select your port:</strong> Go to <code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">Tools {'>'} Port</code>. You should see a COM port (on Windows) or a /dev/tty port (on macOS/Linux) that corresponds to your Arduino. It might be labeled with the board name. If you're unsure, unplug your Arduino and check the Port menu, then plug it back in and see which new port appears.

            Click the "Upload" button (it looks like a right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE.
          </li>
          <li>
            If everything is set up correctly, the IDE will compile the sketch and upload it to your board. You should see "Done uploading." in the status bar. The built-in LED (often labeled 'L') on your Arduino board should start blinking!

          Digital pins are the fundamental way an Arduino interacts with many types of electronic components. They can be configured as either inputs or outputs and can only be in one of two states: HIGH (typically 5V or 3.3V depending on the board) or LOW (0V or Ground).
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Configuring Pin Mode</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Before you can use a digital pin, you must tell the Arduino whether it's an INPUT or an OUTPUT. This is done in the <code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">setup()</code> function using the <code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">pinMode()</code> function.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="cpp" code={`
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // Sets digital pin 13 as an output

        <p className="mb-2">
          When a pin is configured as an OUTPUT, you can set its state to HIGH or LOW using the <code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">digitalWrite()</code> function. This is commonly used to turn LEDs on/off or to control relays.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="cpp" code={`
// Assume pin 13 is already set as OUTPUT in setup()
digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // Turns pin 13 ON (HIGH)

digitalWrite(13, LOW);  // Turns pin 13 OFF (LOW)

        <p className="mb-2">
          When a pin is configured as an INPUT, you can read its state (HIGH or LOW) using the <code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">digitalRead()</code> function. This is used with components like buttons or simple switches.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="cpp" code={`
// Assume pin 2 is already set as INPUT in setup()

        <p className="mb-4">
          When using a digital pin as an input for a switch or button, it's important to avoid "floating" inputs. A floating input occurs when the pin is not connected to either HIGH or LOW, and its state can be unpredictable. To solve this, you can use a pull-up or pull-down resistor.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
            Arduino has built-in pull-up resistors that you can enable by setting the pin mode to <code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">INPUT_PULLUP</code>. This connects the pin to VCC (HIGH) through an internal resistor.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="cpp" code={`

  // and LOW when the button IS pressed (connecting the pin to Ground).
  if (buttonState == LOW) {
    // Button is pressed

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          Many sensors and devices in the real world produce analog signals, which are continuous and can have any value within a certain range (unlike digital signals which are only HIGH or LOW). Arduino boards have dedicated analog input pins to read these signals.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What are Analog Signals?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          An analog signal is a continuous electrical signal for which the time varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., analogous to another time varying signal. For example, the voltage from a potentiometer, the light level from a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), or the temperature from an analog temperature sensor are all analog signals.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Arduino's Analog Pins</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Most Arduino boards (like the Uno) have a set of analog input pins, usually labeled A0, A1, A2, etc. These pins are connected to an internal Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The ADC on an Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno) is typically a 10-bit converter. This means it can map input voltages between 0 and the operating voltage (usually 5V or 3.3V) into integer values between 0 and 1023.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>A voltage of 0V will result in an ADC reading of 0.</li>
          <li>A voltage of 5V (on a 5V Arduino) will result in an ADC reading of 1023.</li>
          <li>A voltage of 2.5V will result in an ADC reading of approximately 512.</li>

        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As you turn the potentiometer knob, the voltage on the middle pin will vary between 0V and 5V, and the <code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">analogRead(A0)</code> function will return values between 0 and 1023.

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          While Arduino's digital pins can only output HIGH or LOW, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) allows you to simulate an analog output. This is useful for tasks like controlling the brightness of an LED, the speed of a DC motor, or the position of a servo motor.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What is PWM?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          PWM is a technique where a digital signal is switched between ON (HIGH) and OFF (LOW) very rapidly. The "duty cycle" of the signal is the percentage of time the signal is ON compared to its total period. By varying the duty cycle, you can change the average power delivered to a device, effectively simulating an analog voltage level.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>A 0% duty cycle means the signal is always OFF.</li>
          <li>A 100% duty cycle means the signal is always ON.</li>
          <li>A 50% duty cycle means the signal is ON for half the time and OFF for the other half. This results in an average voltage that is half of the HIGH voltage.</li>

        <p className="mb-4">
          On most Arduino boards (like the Uno), not all digital pins support PWM. The PWM-capable pins are typically marked with a tilde (<code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">~</code>) or "PWM" next to the pin number (e.g., pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 on an Uno).

        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A value of 0 corresponds to a 0% duty cycle (signal is always LOW). A value of 255 corresponds to a 100% duty cycle (signal is always HIGH). A value of 127 is approximately a 50% duty cycle.

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Arduino IDE includes a Serial Monitor (Tools {'>'} Serial Monitor, or click the magnifying glass icon). Make sure the baud rate selected in the Serial Monitor matches the one set in <code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">Serial.begin()</code> in your sketch. You can use it to view data sent by Arduino and to send data to Arduino.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Serial communication is invaluable for debugging, controlling your Arduino from a computer, and for communication between multiple microcontrollers or devices.
