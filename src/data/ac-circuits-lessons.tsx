        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          Welcome to the world of Alternating Current (AC) circuits! This lesson introduces the fundamental concepts of AC, which is the form of electricity that powers our homes and industries.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What is Alternating Current (AC)?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Alternating Current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction, in contrast to Direct Current (DC) which flows only in one direction. The most common waveform for AC is a sine wave.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Key Characteristics of AC Sine Waves</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 pl-4">
          <li><strong>Frequency (f):</strong> The number of cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Standard power line frequency is 50 Hz or 60 Hz depending on the region.</li>
          <li><strong>Period (T):</strong> The time it takes to complete one full cycle (T = 1/f).</li>
          <li><strong>Amplitude (Peak Value):</strong> The maximum value of voltage or current from the zero point.</li>
          <li><strong>Peak-to-Peak Value:</strong> The difference between the maximum positive and maximum negative amplitudes.</li>
          <li><strong>RMS (Root Mean Square) Value:</strong> The effective value of an AC voltage or current. For a sine wave, V<sub>RMS</sub> = V<sub>peak</sub> / âˆš2. This is the value typically quoted for AC supplies (e.g., 120V AC or 230V AC).</li>
          <li><strong>Phase:</strong> The position of a point in time on a waveform cycle. Phase difference describes the time shift between two waveforms of the same frequency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why Use AC?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          AC is widely used for power distribution because its voltage can be easily stepped up or down using transformers. This allows for efficient transmission of power over long distances at high voltages (reducing resistive losses) and then stepping down to safer, usable voltages for consumers.
